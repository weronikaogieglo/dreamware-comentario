The term **comment tree**, also called **comment thread**, means that [comments](comment) are organized in a tree structure, so that comments can have children â€” which we call **replies**.

For example:

```
root comment A
  +-- child comment A1
  +-- child comment A2

root comment B
  +-- child comment B1
        +-- child comment B11
  +-- child comment B2
        +- child comment B21
        +- child comment B22
        ...
```

Every child comment can, in turn, also have children (replies), and so on.

Every [domain page](domain-page) has an own comment tree.
