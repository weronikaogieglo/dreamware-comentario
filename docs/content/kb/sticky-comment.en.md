If a comment has no parent, we call it a *root* or a *top-level comment*. A root comment can be made **sticky**, which will pin it at the top of the [comment tree](comment-tree).

## Sticky and unsticky

* To sticky a comment, click the star (â˜…) button at the bottom of the comment. The button will become yellow, which means the comment is now sticky.\
  When a comment is made sticky, it will always stay at the top of the tree regardless of the current comment sort.\
  When there are multiple sticky comments, they will be sorted accordingly among themselves.
* To unsticky a comment, click on the star button again. Natural comment sort order will be restored.

## Permissions

Only a user having *Moderator* or *Owner* [role](/kb/permissions/roles) or a [superuser](/kb/permissions/superuser) can sticky and unsticky comments.
