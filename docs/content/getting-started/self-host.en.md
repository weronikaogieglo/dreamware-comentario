To self-host a Comentario instance, you'll need two components: a database and a network-attached server machine.

## Database

In the simplest of setups, you can opt to use a local, file-based **SQLite** database; however, it's recommended to use a dedicated, much more robust **PostgreSQL** database in a production environment. Have a look at the [](installation/requirements) document to learn about the database component.

## Server

There's a number of options when it comes to running the server, depending on your demands and network architecture. Please proceed to the [](/installation) page to choose the one that suits you.
