You can easily deploy Comentario into a Kubernetes cluster using a Helm chart.

[Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/) is a modern, production-grade cloud deployment system developed by Google. It provides numerous tools for reliable, scalable cloud deployments, but its flexibility may well prove overwhelming, especially when it comes to deploying multiple components.

Comentario addresses that complexity by providing a so-called [Helm chart](https://helm.sh/), which greatly facilitates server deployment in a cloud environment.

The chart is available in [Comentario git repository](/about/source-code) in the `resources/helm/comentario` directory.
