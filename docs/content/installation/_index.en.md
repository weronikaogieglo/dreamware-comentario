This page explains how you can self-host Comentario.

You can install Comentario locally or deploy it somewhere on the Internet.

Depending on your needs, Comentario can be installed and run in a number of ways:

* From a **binary package**: locally. This will require a manual HTTPS (SSL) configuration.
* Into a **Kubernetes cluster**: using its Helm chart. This is the most straightforward way to deploy Comentario if you have Kubernetes.
* Using a **Docker image**. This might prove a bit more involved, especially when in comes to HTTPS (SSL) configuration.
* By building from **source code**: the hard way.

If you're upgrading from a previous Comentario version, or upgrading from Commento/Commento++, we've covered that, too â€” make sure to check the [](migration) section.
