**[Comentario](https://comentario.app)** is an open-source web comment engine, which adds discussion functionality to plain, boring web pages.

You can embed it in your website to allow your readers to add comments. It's fast, powerful, flexible, and easy to use. Have a look at our [live demo](https://demo.comentario.app/) to see it in action!
